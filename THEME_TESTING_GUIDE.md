## Performance Test

1. Open 5+ windows
2. Switch themes multiple times
3. Verify no lag or slowdown
4. Check CSS custom properties update smoothly

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (should work perfectly)
- [ ] Firefox (should work perfectly)
- [ ] Safari (check CSS custom property support)

---

## Known Working State

After the recent theme fix (Phase 6.5), all themes should:
‚úÖ Apply instantly via CSS custom properties
‚úÖ Show correct text colors (white in Dark Mode)
‚úÖ Update all UI components simultaneously
‚úÖ Persist across page refreshes (when wallet connected)
‚úÖ Work in all major browsers

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Text is black in Dark Mode
**Solution:** Check that component CSS uses `--theme-text` instead of `--mac-black`

**Problem:** Theme doesn't switch
**Solution:** Verify ThemeProvider is wrapping app in `app/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Theme doesn't persist
**Solution:** Ensure wallet is connected and DATABASE_URL is set

**Problem:** Some components don't theme
**Solution:** Check that component CSS uses theme variables with fallbacks
