## ‚è≥ **After Deploy is Live**

### **Step 2: Verify Manifest is Accessible**

Open in browser:
```
https://nounsos.wtf/.well-known/farcaster.json
```

‚úÖ **Should show:** Your miniapp JSON
‚ùå **If 404:** Wait a minute for deploy, then refresh

---

### **Step 3: Sign the Manifest (CRITICAL!)**

**This is REQUIRED for Mini App to work in Farcaster.**

1. **Go to Manifest Tool** (desktop browser):
   ```
   https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames
   ```

2. **Enter Domain:**
   ```
   nounsos.wtf
   ```
   (no https://, just the domain)

3. **Click "Validate"**
   - Should show your manifest details

4. **Scroll to Bottom ‚Üí Click "Claim Ownership"**

5. **Sign with Farcaster Custody Address:**
   - You'll get a prompt to sign with your phone
   - Open Warpcast app on your phone
   - Follow the signing flow
   - This proves you own nounsos.wtf

6. **Copy the Signed Manifest:**
   - After signing, the tool shows the full manifest
   - Copy the ENTIRE JSON (includes `accountAssociation` section)
   - Should look like:
   ```json
   {
     "accountAssociation": {
       "header": "eyJmaWQ...",
       "payload": "eyJkb21...",
       "signature": "MHgwZmJ..."
     },
     "miniapp": {
       "version": "1",
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Update Your Manifest File:**
   ```bash
   # Replace the contents of public/.well-known/farcaster.json
   # with the signed version you just copied
   ```

8. **Deploy the Signed Manifest:**
   ```bash
   git add public/.well-known/farcaster.json
   git commit -m "Add signed Farcaster manifest"
   git push origin main
   ```

   ```
3. **Expected:** Frame appears with "Launch Nouns OS" button

## üêõ **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **Frame not appearing?**
- Check metadata in browser: View Page Source ‚Üí search for `fc:frame`
- Verify manifest at: https://nounsos.wtf/.well-known/farcaster.json

### **"Claim Ownership" button not working?**
- Must use **custody address** (not connected wallet)
- Must sign via Warpcast mobile app
- Check you're logged into correct Farcaster account

### **Mini App won't launch?**
- Verify manifest is **signed** (has `accountAssociation`)
- Check all URLs point to `nounsos.wtf` (not localhost or vercel)
- Ensure using HTTPS (not HTTP)

### **Wallet not connecting?**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` set in Vercel
- Test in Warpcast app (not browser)
- Check `farcasterMiniApp()` connector in wagmi config

---

## üìã **Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

### **Required:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### **Optional (but recommended):**
```env
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FARCASTER_DEVELOPER_MNEMONIC="your mnemonic"
```
