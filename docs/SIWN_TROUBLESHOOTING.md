# SIWN Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Continue with Berry OS" Button Not Working

### What Should Happen:

1. User clicks "Sign in with Neynar"
2. Popup opens to `https://app.neynar.com/login`
3. User authenticates with Farcaster
4. Neynar redirects to `/api/auth/neynar/callback`
5. Callback page shows "Continue with Berry OS" button
6. **User clicks button** â†’ Message sent to main window
7. Main window receives auth data
8. Popup closes automatically
9. User is signed in!

### Debugging Steps:

#### 1. Check Browser Console (Main Window)

Open browser console (F12) in the **main Berry OS window** and look for:

```
Started listening for auth messages...
Received message: neynar-auth-success [origin]
Authentication successful! {fid, username, ...}
```

If you DON'T see these messages, the postMessage isn't reaching the main window.

#### 2. Check Browser Console (Popup Window)

Open console in the **popup window** (callback page) and check:

- Is `window.opener` defined?
- Is `window.opener.closed` false?
- Are there any errors when calling `postMessage`?

#### 3. Test postMessage Manually

In the **popup window console**, try:

```javascript
// Check if opener is available
console.log('Opener exists:', !!window.opener);
console.log('Opener closed:', window.opener?.closed);

// Try to send message manually
window.opener.postMessage({
  type: 'neynar-auth-success',
  data: {
    fid: 123,
    username: 'test',
    displayName: 'Test User',
    pfpUrl: '',
    signerUuid: 'test-uuid',
    token: 'test-token'
  }
}, '*');
```

Then check the **main window console** - you should see the message received.

#### 4. Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Received message: undefined"**
- The message event doesn't have the expected structure
- Check that callback is sending the correct data format

**Issue: No messages received at all**
- Check if popup blocker is blocking communication
- Try disabling browser extensions temporarily
- Check if popup was opened from the correct origin

**Issue: "window.opener is null"**
- Popup might have been redirected through multiple pages
- Try using a different browser
- Check if "Continue with Berry OS" button is actually triggering the function

**Issue: Message received but auth state not updating**
- Check localStorage: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('farcaster_auth'))`
- Look for errors in the `handleMessage` function
- Verify `saveAuthState` is being called

#### 5. Manual Authentication (For Testing)

If SIWN is not working, you can manually set auth state in the console:

```javascript
// In main Berry OS window console
localStorage.setItem('farcaster_auth', JSON.stringify({
  fid: 3621,
  username: 'testuser',
  displayName: 'Test User',
  pfpUrl: '',
  authToken: 'test-token-' + Date.now(),
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
}));

// Then reload
window.location.reload();
```

### Updated Callback Flow

The callback now:

1. âœ… Sends message immediately on page load
2. âœ… Shows styled "Continue with Berry OS" button
3. âœ… Uses `origin: '*'` to ensure cross-origin messaging works
4. âœ… Has fallback error handling
5. âœ… Logs all actions for debugging

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign out completely (clear localStorage)
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Neynar"
- [ ] Popup opens successfully
- [ ] Complete Farcaster authentication
- [ ] Land on callback page with "Continue" button
- [ ] Open console in BOTH windows (main + popup)
- [ ] Click "Continue with Berry OS"
- [ ] Check console for messages
- [ ] Verify popup closes
- [ ] Verify main window updates with user info

### Debug Logs to Look For

**Main Window Console:**
```
Started listening for auth messages...
Received message: neynar-auth-success http://localhost:3000
Authentication successful! {fid: 3621, username: "..."}
```

**Popup Window Console:**
```
(No errors about window.opener)
(No CORS errors)
```

### Alternative: Check Network Tab

1. Open Network tab (F12 â†’ Network)
2. Go through auth flow
3. Look for the request to `/api/auth/neynar/callback`
4. Check the response - should be HTML with the success page
5. Verify the auth data is embedded in the script

### Quick Test Script

Run this in the **main window console** after clicking sign in:

```javascript
// Monitor all postMessage events
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  console.log('ðŸ“¨ Message received:', {
    type: event.data?.type,
    origin: event.origin,
    data: event.data
  });
}, true);

console.log('âœ… Now monitoring all messages...');
```

Then go through the auth flow and watch for messages.

### Expected Data Structure

The callback should send:

```javascript
{
  type: 'neynar-auth-success',
  data: {
    fid: number,
    username: string,
    displayName: string,
    pfpUrl: string,
    signerUuid: string,
    token: string
  }
}
```

### Still Not Working?

1. **Check Neynar Dashboard**: Verify Authorized Origins includes `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Check Environment Variables**: Verify both API key and Client ID are set
3. **Try Different Browser**: Some extensions block postMessage
4. **Check CORS**: Open browser console and look for CORS errors
5. **Verify Callback URL**: Should be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/neynar/callback`

### Success Indicators

âœ… Console shows "Started listening for auth messages..."
âœ… Popup opens and loads successfully
âœ… Callback page shows "Continue with Berry OS" button
âœ… Clicking button logs messages in main window
âœ… Auth data is stored in localStorage
âœ… Main window updates with username
âœ… Popup closes automatically

### Contact for Help

If still stuck:
1. Share console logs from BOTH windows
2. Share Network tab showing callback response
3. Share your Neynar dashboard Authorized Origins config
4. Check if browser extensions are interfering
