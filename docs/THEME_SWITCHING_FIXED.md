# Theme Switching Fixed! 🎨✨

## Issue Fixed
Users were getting "stuck" with custom themes and couldn't switch back to built-in preset themes.

## Root Cause
- Custom theme was stored in `systemStore.customTheme`
- When user selected a preset theme, `customTheme` wasn't being cleared
- ThemeProvider prioritizes `customTheme` over preset themes
- Result: Custom theme always displayed, even when preset was selected

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Preset Theme Selection Now Clears Custom Theme

**New Function**: `handlePresetThemeSelect()`
```typescript
const handlePresetThemeSelect = (themeId: string) => {
  console.log(`🎨 Switching to preset theme: ${themeId}`);
  // Clear any custom theme first
  clearCustomTheme();
  // Then switch to the preset theme
  onThemeChange(themeId);
};
```

**What it does**:
1. Clears `systemStore.customTheme` 
2. Switches to the selected preset theme
3. ThemeProvider now uses preset theme (no custom override)

### 2. Visual Feedback for Active Theme

**Updated Theme Cards**:
- Checkmark only shows when theme is **both** selected AND no custom theme is active
- Shows which preset the custom theme was based on

```typescript
className={`${styles.themeCard} ${activeTheme === theme.id && !customTheme ? styles.selected : ''}`}

{activeTheme === theme.id && !customTheme && (
  <div className={styles.checkmark}>✓</div>
)}
```

### 3. Improved Custom Colors Section UI

**Before**:
```
[ Customize Colors... ]
Opens an advanced theme editor with 8 tabs of color controls
```

**After (when custom theme active)**:
```
✓ Custom Theme Active

You're using a custom theme based on Classic. 
Click "Edit Colors" to continue customizing, or "Clear Custom Theme" to return to the preset.

[ ✏️ Edit Colors ]
[ 🔄 Clear Custom Theme ]

Custom themes are saved in your session. Connect wallet to save permanently.
```

**After (no custom theme)**:
```
Customize every part of your Berry OS interface...

[ 🎨 Customize Colors ]

Opens an advanced theme editor with 8 tabs of color controls
```

### 4. Better Cancel Behavior in ThemeBuilder

**Tracks Previous State**:
```typescript
const [themeBeforeEdit, setThemeBeforeEdit] = useState<Theme | null>(null);

// On open
setThemeBeforeEdit(customTheme); // Remember what was active

// On cancel
if (themeBeforeEdit === null) {
  clearCustomTheme(); // No custom theme before, clear it
} else {
  setCustomTheme(themeBeforeEdit); // Restore previous custom theme
}
```

**What this fixes**:
- ✅ Cancel now properly reverts to state before opening ThemeBuilder
- ✅ If you had no custom theme, cancel clears any changes
- ✅ If you had a custom theme, cancel restores it (doesn't clear)

### 5. Clear Custom Theme Button

Users can now explicitly clear their custom theme without switching themes:

```typescript
<Button 
  onClick={() => {
    clearCustomTheme();
    console.log('🔄 Cleared custom theme, reverted to preset');
  }}
  variant="cancel"
>
  🔄 Clear Custom Theme
</Button>
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Stuck with Custom Theme (FIXED!)
1. User had custom theme active
2. User clicks "Classic" preset → **Custom theme clears automatically** ✅
3. Classic theme displays
4. User clicks "Dark" preset → Dark theme displays ✅
5. Everything works smoothly!

### Scenario 2: Editing Then Canceling
1. User on "Classic" preset (no custom theme)
2. Opens ThemeBuilder, changes colors (live preview)
3. Clicks "Cancel" → **Reverts to Classic preset** ✅
4. No custom theme remains

### Scenario 3: Editing Existing Custom Theme
1. User has custom theme active
2. Opens ThemeBuilder, changes more colors
3. Clicks "Cancel" → **Restores previous custom theme** ✅
4. Changes are discarded

### Scenario 4: Clearing Custom Theme
1. User has custom theme active
2. Clicks "🔄 Clear Custom Theme" button
3. **Custom theme clears** ✅
4. Reverts to underlying preset theme (e.g., Classic)

## Technical Details

### Theme Priority System
```typescript
// In ThemeProvider
const theme = customTheme || getThemeById(activeTheme);

// Priority:
// 1. customTheme (if set) ← User's custom colors
// 2. activeTheme preset  ← Built-in theme
```

### State Management
```typescript
// systemStore.ts
{
  activeTheme: 'classic',        // Which preset is "underneath"
  customTheme: null,             // Custom colors overlay (if any)
  accentColor: null,             // Quick accent override
  themeCustomization: {}         // Corner style, opacity, etc.
}
```

### How Clearing Works
```typescript
clearCustomTheme: () => {
  set({ customTheme: null });
  console.log('✨ Custom theme cleared, reverting to preset');
}
```
